# Pseudocode:

#Calculate a running sum
A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result


// User will enter numbers
// numbers are stored in an array.
# WHILE LOOP
    // SET counter
        //let x=0,
    // WHILE counter is still true ( x <= 'number_of_numbers_stored' x++) THEN
        // FOR (a the next positive number in array) THEN
            // DO the summation
// DISPLAY (RESULT)
